				<h1>Fine Line</h1>
				<p>Fine Line is my third favorite Harry Styles song. There's not much to say about why I like this song. It perefectly ends his second album. The crashing in of instruments at the climax of the song is beautiful, and the fading of them is even more emotional. The last not just brings home an amazing and gut-wrenching song.

<br>Put a price on emotion
<br>I'm looking for something to buy
<br>You've got my devotion
<br>But man, I can hate you sometimes
<br>I don't want to fight you
<br>And I don't wanna sleep in the dirt
<br>We'll get the drinks in
<br>So I'll get to thinking of her
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>Test of my patience
<br>There's things that we'll never know
<br>You sunshine, you temptress
<br>My hand's at risk, I fold
<br>Crisp trepidation
<br>I'll try to shake this soon
<br>Spreading you open
<br>Is the only way of knowing you
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be alright
<br>We'll be alright
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be alright (alright, alright, alright)
<br>We'll be alright
<br>We'll be alright
<br>
