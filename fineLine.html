					Put a price on emotion
<br>I'm looking for something to buy
<br>You've got my devotion
<br>But man, I can hate you sometimes
<br>I don't want to fight you
<br>And I don't wanna sleep in the dirt
<br>We'll get the drinks in
<br>So I'll get to thinking of her
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>Test of my patience
<br>There's things that we'll never know
<br>You sunshine, you temptress
<br>My hand's at risk, I fold
<br>Crisp trepidation
<br>I'll try to shake this soon
<br>Spreading you open
<br>Is the only way of knowing you
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be alright
<br>We'll be alright
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be a fine line
<br>We'll be alright (alright, alright, alright)
<br>We'll be alright
<br>We'll be alright
