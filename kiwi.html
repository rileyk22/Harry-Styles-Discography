				<h1>Kiwi</h1>
				<p>Kiwi is my fourth favorite Harry Styles song. It's the seventh song off his first album. I love the very rock element of the song. I also love how during some parts of the song Styles is almost screaming the lyrics. This song is amazing to see live. Styles goes all out jumping and dancing around the stage like a crazy person.

				<br>Lyrics
				<br>
<br>She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
<br>Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
<br>And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
<br>Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck
<br>She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
<br>I'm kind of into it
<br>It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
<br>Oh, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it' none of your)
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your"
<br>It's New York, baby, always jacked up
<br>Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
<br>When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus
<br>In a black dress, she's such an actress
<br>Driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
<br>I'm kind of into it
<br>It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
<br>Oh, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it' none of your)
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your"
<br>She sits beside me like a silhouette
<br>Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
<br>And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it (cha-ching)
<br>It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this
<br>It's none of your, it's none of your
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" 
<br>(It's none of your, none of your)
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
<br>"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" 
<br>It's none of your, none of your)
