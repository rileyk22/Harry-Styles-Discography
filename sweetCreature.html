				<h1>Sweet Creature</h1>
				<p>Sweet Creature is my favorite Harry Styles Song. It is the fifth track off his first self titled debut ablbum. I think the acoustic guitar makes the romantic song sound more personal than what have it woukd have sounded like with synthetic instruments. I also love how his voice sounds at the live preformances of this song.  </p>

<br>Sweet creature
<br>Had another talk about where it's going wrong
<br>But we're still young
<br>We don't know where we're going
<br>But we know where we belong
<br>And oh we started
<br>Two hearts in one home
<br>It's hard when we argue
<br>We're both stubborn
<br>I know, but oh
<br>And oh we started
<br>Two hearts in one home
<br>We're both stubborn
<br>I know, but oh
<br>Sweet creature, sweet creature
<br>Wherever I go, you bring me home
<br>Sweet creature, sweet creature
<br>When I run out of road, you bring me home
<br>Sweet creature
<br>We're running through the garden
<br>Oh, where nothing bothered us
<br>But we're still young
<br>I always think about you and how we don't speak enough
<br>And oh we started
<br>Two hearts in one home
<br>I know, it's hard when we argue
<br>We're both stubborn
<br>I know, but oh
<br>Sweet creature, sweet creature
<br>Wherever I go, you bring me home
<br>Sweet creature, sweet creature
<br>When I run out of road, you bring me home
<br>I know when we started
<br>Just two hearts in one home
<br>It gets harder when we argue
<br>We're both stubborn
<br>I know, but oh
<br>Sweet creature, sweet creature
<br>Wherever I go, you bring me home
<br>Sweet creature, sweet creature
<br>When I run out of road, you bring me home
<br>You'll bring me home
<br>
