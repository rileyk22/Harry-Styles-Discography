				<h1>Cherry</h1>
				<p>Cherry is my second favorite Harry Styles song. It is the fifth song off his second album Fine Line. Like Sweet Creature the acoustic guitar use makes the song more personal and more sorrwoful. Cherry is one of the singer's saddest songs in my opinion. In te lyrics Harry talks about missing an ex-girlfriend and being jealous of her new boyfriend. It has an element of pettiness to it as well which gives his fans a deep view on how he deals with heartbreak.

<br>Don't you call him "baby"
<br>We're not talking lately
<br>Don't you call him what you used to call me
<br>I, I confess
<br>I can tell that you are at your best
<br>I'm selfish so I'm hating it
<br>I notice that
<br>There's a piece of you in how I dress
<br>Take it as a compliment
<br>Don't you call him "baby"
<br>We're not talking lately
<br>Don't you call him what you used to call me
<br>I, I just miss
<br>I just miss your accent and your friends
<br>Did you know I still talk to them?
<br>Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?
<br>Don't you call him "baby"
<br>We're not talking lately
<br>Don't you call him what you used to call me
<br>Don't you call him "baby"
<br>We're not talking lately
<br>Don't you call him what you used to call me
<br>
